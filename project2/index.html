          What is fake news? You can probably guess what it is just from its name but each person tends to have a slightly different view of what they would consider "fake news".
          At its core, fake news is news that are, as you've guessed, false. They are made up of facts, sources, or quotes that haven't been verified as true, creating a "fake" story
          for whatever purpose the author wants to achieve may it be innocent or malignant. This can be in a physical form or on the internet. Social media is especially prone to
          quickly spreading fake news with its ease of access.

          Fake news can be seperated into three different types of problems that causes it which is Mis-information, Dis-information, and Mal-information. These three types of problems
          will be discussed more in-depth in their own personal pages available in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
