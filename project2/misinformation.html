          To put it simply, misinformation is false information that is spread regardless of it being innocent or malignant in reason. This type of problem tends to happen the most
          as it is quite common for a post or tweet to catch peoples attention causing it to be reposted/retweeted multiple times. This allows it to spread very quickly between people
          regardless if it was the truth or not. Fake news tend to catch people's attentions more than the truth as they tend to appeal more to their emotions or just seem very "novel"
          which increases the chance of it being spread. Misinformation are also spread through small mistakes. Humans as we know, are imperfect beings. We can mishear or misremember
          the details of certain things and when we share it, we are imparting our own "fake" version of the story to others.
