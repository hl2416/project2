          Malinformation is quite similar to disinformation in that both are caused for malignant reasons. Malinformation, however, is based off of "real" facts to make it seem more
          believable such as taking a picture and writing something that is based on what is seen in the picture but is actually false. As such, the difference is that disinformation is
          essentially all false, while malinformation contains some truth in it. Its just that the truth is warped to fit the users purpose which would essentially be the same as that of
          disinformation where it is used to mainpulate people into doing something. Both take advantage of the emotions of the people which also causes it to spread just as quickly as
          misinformation.
