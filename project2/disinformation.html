          Disinformation, unlike misinformation, is false information that is created to deliberately harm a person, group, organization, or country. In other words, it is spreading fake
          information while knowing that it is fake to cause harm to others. This, again like misinformation, can be spread via both physically or online. Propaganda is one of the most well
          known modes of disinformation. A country may create commercials, posters, speeches, etc. to slander another country to increase their people's willingness to go to war or to show
          people how great it is to do something. In this case, the purpose is to manipulate people to do something that the other party wants. Disinformation is a dangerous tool that can
          cause many conseqences.
